	Obligatory _Hello World_ article to inaugurate my new and shiny personal website.

	This website is powered by [Astro](https://astro.build/) and hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)
	for a blazing website! You also might recognized the template from TailwindUI's [Spotlight](https://tailwindui.com/templates/spotlight)
	that I've ported from Nextjs to Astro.

	You can find the source code of this website on my [Github right here](https://github.com/grenierdev/grenier.dev).

	See you soon!
